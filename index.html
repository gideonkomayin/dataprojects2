									<h2><a href="#">Connectel Customer Churn Prediction Analysis using Python and Machine Learning</a></h2>
									<p>This is a unique project, because it had a lot of customer data coming in from various categories of customers in Telecommunications, like gender, payment method, tenure e.tc. We discovered through thorough analysis and visualization, the categories of customers with a higher potential churn rate than others. The suggestions we gave helped to reduce the churning rate by 10%. This analysis was perfomed using Python.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Analysing Engineering Maintenance Key Performance Indicators using Microcoft Excel</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/maintenance-kpi.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> An Engineering-maintenance department of a manufacturing company does not have an evidence of performance reviews such as an updated KPI dashboard, which is a major factor in tracking organizational performance and a standard in reliability engineering. This was missing on a regular Maintenance and Reliability audit. To resolve this, an interactive dashboard was created showing an overview of maintenance key metrics. Performance Review Mechanisms now available to track various KPIs and other metrics. About 25-30% drop in failure rates were realised in 3 months and Mean time between failures (MTBF) increased on most assets and components.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Predicting Customer Churn with the aid of Python and ML to Identify Customers that are Susceptible to Churn in order to Enhance Retention Strategies and Boost Business Growth</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/PREDICTING CHURNING IN TELECOMMUNICATION.webp" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Reder Telecom is facing an increasing rate of customer churn, which is the percentage of customers who switch to competitors' services or terminate their subscriptions. The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, with multiple players offering similar services, and retaining existing customers is becoming increasingly difficult. We developed a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning and analyzed the key factors contributing to customer churn. </p>
